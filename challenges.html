            <h1>Jesus Christ Challenges</h1>
    
            <h2>Back Then Jesus Christ Had A Lot Of Challenges </h2>
    
            <p>Although most of us see Jesus Christ as a savior to us back then The Romans saw him as a threat to their empire for example : </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>They believe in only one god</li>
                <li>Bhutan</li>
                <li>Nepal</li>
                <li>India</li>
                <li>Pakistan</li>
                <li>Afghanistan</li>
                <li>Russia</li>
                <li>Mongolia</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Causes of Snow Leopard Population Decline</h2>
    
            <p>Many factors contribute to their declining numbers in these countries. Some of the top causes are: </p>
    
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Climate change</strong> - greatest long term threat that could destroy 30% of their habitat</li>
                <li><strong>Local communities</strong> - kill the animals that snow leopards prey upon</li>
                <li><strong>Killed by farmers</strong> - when they are forced to prey on livestock to survive</li>
                <li><strong>Human settlement in their range</strong> - forces them to survive in smaller areas with less prey</li>
            </ol>
