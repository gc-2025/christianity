            <p>Jesus[d] (c. 6 to 4 BC – AD 30 or 33), also referred to as Jesus Christ,[e] Jesus of Nazareth, and many other names and titles, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader.[10] He is the central figure of Christianity and a major figure in Islam, the world's largest religions. Christians and Muslims believe Jesus is the awaited messiah, though the role differs in Christianity and in Islam. Most Christian denominations believe this means Jesus is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited Christ, a descendant from the Davidic line prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree Jesus existed historically.[f] Accounts of Jesus's life are contained in the Gospels, especially the four canonical Gospels in the New Testament. Academic research has yielded various views on the historical reliability of the Gospels and how closely they reflect the historical Jesus.[g] </p>

            <p>Jesus was circumcised at eight days old, was baptized by John the Baptist as a young adult, and after 40 days and nights of fasting in the wilderness, began his own ministry. He was an itinerant teacher who interpreted the law of God with divine authority and was often referred to as "rabbi".[23] Jesus often debated with his fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables, and gathered followers, among whom twelve were appointed as his chosen apostles. He was arrested in Jerusalem and tried by the Jewish authorities,[24] turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. After his death, his followers became convinced he rose from the dead, and following his ascension, the community they formed eventually became the early Christian Church and expanded as a worldwide movement.[25] It is hypothesized that accounts of his teachings and life were initially conserved by oral transmission, which was the source of the written Gospels.[26]</p>

            <p>Christian theology and Islamic theology agree Jesus was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, then ascended to heaven from where he will return to Earth in the Second Coming. Commonly, Christians believe he was conceived by the Holy Spirit and died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, which enables people to be reconciled to God. Christians believe Jesus then rose from the dead, ascended into heaven, and will return. The Nicene Creed asserts Jesus will judge the living and the dead, either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity.[h] The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually during Christmas, generally on 25 December.[i] His crucifixion is honoured on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The world's most widely used calendar era—in which the current year is AD 2025 (or 2025 CE)—is based on the approximate date of the birth of Jesus.[27] </p>

            <p>Jesus in Islam[j] is considered the messiah and a prophet of God, who was sent to the Israelites and will return before the Day of Judgement. Muslims do not believe Jesus is God nor a son of God. Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive.[k] Jesus is also revered in the Baháʼí Faith, Druze, and Rastafari religions. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief Jesus was the awaited Messiah, arguing he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, was not lawfully anointed and was neither divine nor resurrected.</p>
