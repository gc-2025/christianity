                <li>The pain of betrayal</li>
                <li>Abandonment</li>

                <li>Death</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>The crown of thorns</strong> - When he finally got crucified they putted a crown of thorns that pierced into the side of his head</li>
                <li><strong>He died for ours sins</strong> - Even though he went though all that pain he went though all that to died for ours sins</li>
